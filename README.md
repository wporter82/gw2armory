<h2>Guild Wars 2 Armory</h2>
<p>
This is an ongoing project that will be a client-based app to access a Guild Wars 2 account. All data is stored locally within
the browser and all communication is done with the official
<a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main" target="_blank">Guild Wars 2 API</a>. This is to ensure that the app can be
run on almost any server and that there is no data to compromise there.
</p>
<p>
The armory app is used to inspect account details and character information while not logged into the game. The API provides
read-only access, so you won't be able to do anything other than inspect items or account info.
